Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars

I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashin' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no…

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no…
